# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains anonymized numeric features without specific labels, reflecting real-world data where sensitive information is concealed. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately identifies fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives.

## **Overview**  
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial sector. This project leverages machine learning models to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions based on anonymized numeric features provided in the dataset.

### **Features**  
30 anonymized numeric columns (e.g., V1, V2, ..., V30) and a Class column:  
Class = 0: Legitimate transaction  
Class = 1: Fraudulent transaction

#### **Approach**
**Data Preprocessing** : No missing/NULL values to be handled  
**Model Selection**: Tested Logistic regression model  
**Model Evaluation:**  
- Accuracy on Training Data: 94.91%  
- Accuracy on Testing Data: 92.89%
